# AI Expert SDLC Project Plan
**Project**: Automated Requirements Engineering with AI Expert Agents  
**Date**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  

## 🎯 Vision Statement
Transform requirements engineering from manual human-driven processes to collaborative AI expert systems that debate, refine, and reach consensus on project artifacts before human review. Create a self-improving knowledge graph that learns from expert insights and real-world data.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **AI Expert Agent Triad**
   - Requirements Engineer: User stories, acceptance criteria, stakeholder analysis
   - Project Planner: Milestones, timelines, risk assessment, resource allocation  
   - System Architect: Technical design, patterns, interfaces, scalability

2. **Debate & Consensus Engine**
   - Multi-round discussions between experts
   - Challenge assumptions and propose alternatives
   - Reach consensus before human submission
   - Track dissent and reasoning for learning

3. **Knowledge Graph Dynamics** 
   - Neo4j backend with Wikidata QID anchoring
   - Enrichment-driven relationship weighting
   - Temporal evolution tracking
   - Cross-project knowledge transfer

4. **Human Oversight Layer**
   - Strategic decision points only
   - Quality gates and approval workflows
   - Exception handling for AI disagreements
   - System training and calibration

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish AI Expert infrastructure and basic debate mechanics

#### Deliverables:
- **AI Expert Personas** (`intake/ai_experts/`)
  - Requirements Engineer persona with specialized prompts
  - Project Planner persona with estimation templates  
  - System Architect persona with design patterns
- **Function Calling Schemas** (`schema/ai_experts/`)
  - Structured outputs for each expert domain
  - Validation rules for artifact quality
  - Cross-expert communication protocols
- **Debate Orchestrator** (`tools/debate/`)
  - Multi-agent conversation management
  - Consensus detection algorithms
  - Conflict resolution procedures
- **Basic Testing Framework**
  - Unit tests for each expert persona
  - Integration tests for debate flows
  - Quality metrics for consensus outcomes

#### Success Criteria:
- 3 AI experts can analyze a simple requirement
- Basic debate mechanism produces reasoned discussions
- Consensus artifacts pass schema validation
- Human can review and approve/reject outcomes

### Phase 2: Knowledge Integration (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Connect AI experts to enriched knowledge graph

#### Deliverables:
- **Enrichment-Aware Experts**
  - Experts query Wikidata/Perplexity for context
  - Historical project data influences recommendations
  - Real-world constraints inform technical decisions
- **Neo4j Dynamic Ingestion** (`tools/neo4j/`)
  - Relationship strength based on expert confidence
  - Node clustering by domain expertise patterns
  - Temporal tracking of requirement evolution
- **Cross-Project Learning**
  - Pattern recognition across similar projects
  - Best practice recommendations from graph
  - Anti-pattern warnings from failed projects
- **Enhanced Validation**
  - Enrichment data validates feasibility
  - Market research confirms user needs
  - Technical constraints check implementation

#### Success Criteria:
- Experts provide context-aware recommendations
- Graph shows meaningful relationship patterns
- Cross-project insights improve decision quality
- Validation catches infeasible requirements early

### Phase 3: Advanced Workflows (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Production-ready SDLC automation with human oversight

#### Deliverables:
- **End-to-End Automation** (`tools/orchestrate/`)
  - Intake → Expert Analysis → Debate → Consensus → Enrichment → Graph → Human Review
  - Automated PR creation with expert analysis
  - Quality gates at each phase transition
  - Exception handling for edge cases
- **Human Interface** (`handoff/figma_ui/`)
  - Expert debate visualization
  - Consensus rationale display
  - Override mechanisms for human judgment
  - Training interfaces for expert calibration  
- **Learning & Adaptation**
  - Expert performance metrics and tuning
  - Debate quality improvement over time
  - Human feedback integration
  - Knowledge graph evolution tracking
- **Production Deployment**
  - CI/CD for expert persona updates
  - Monitoring and alerting for system health
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Security and access controls

#### Success Criteria:
- Complete SDLC automation for standard requirements
- Human intervention only for strategic decisions
- System learns and improves from each project
- Quality metrics show improvement over time
