# Expert Debate: Automated SysML-based SDLC Management System

**Generated:** 2025-09-20 19:17:24

## Problem Statement


    Design an automated SysML-based system to manage the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 
    from planning through requirements to design that is:
    
    1. SELF-DOCUMENTING: The system automatically generates and maintains documentation
    2. FULLY TRACEABLE: Complete bidirectional traceability from requirements to implementation
    3. AUTOMATED: Minimal manual intervention in SDLC process management
    4. SYSML-BASED: Uses SysML v2 as the foundational modeling language
    
    The system should integrate:
    - Project planning and milestone tracking
    - Requirements capture and management  
    - System architecture and design
    - Verification and validation
    - Change management and impact analysis
    
    Consider: SysML v2 constructs, tool integration, automation workflows, traceability mechanisms,
    and how to maintain consistency across all SDLC phases.
