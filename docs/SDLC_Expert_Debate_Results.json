  "problem_statement": "\n    Design an automated SysML-based system to manage the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) \n    from planning through requirements to design that is:\n    \n    1. SELF-DOCUMENTING: The system automatically generates and maintains documentation\n    2. FULLY TRACEABLE: Complete bidirectional traceability from requirements to implementation\n    3. AUTOMATED: Minimal manual intervention in SDLC process management\n    4. SYSML-BASED: Uses SysML v2 as the foundational modeling language\n    \n    The system should integrate:\n    - Project planning and milestone tracking\n    - Requirements capture and management  \n    - System architecture and design\n    - Verification and validation\n    - Change management and impact analysis\n    \n    Consider: SysML v2 constructs, tool integration, automation workflows, traceability mechanisms,\n    and how to maintain consistency across all SDLC phases.\n    ",
