## Summary

This export normalizes the Intake Pack into a KerML-format requirements bundle and traceability mapping suitable for handoffs to architects and planners. It references intake artifacts in `intake/` and lists the key functional, nonfunctional, constraints, milestones, and risks identified in the intake.


## Key facts

- Intake artifacts present: `assumptions.yaml`, `milestones.csv`, `risks.csv`, `scope.yml`, `success_criteria.yaml`
- Missing intake artifact: `backlog.csv` (placeholder recommended)
- Primary source commit: `8ad06a3`


## Traceability table (excerpt)

| Requirement ID | Short title | Source artifact |
|---|---|---|
| req:rail/railweb/feature/spec-library | Spec library | intake/scope.yml |
| req:rail/railweb/feature/scale-conversion | Scale conversion | intake/scope.yml |
| req:rail/railweb/feature/realtime-control | Real-time control | intake/scope.yml |
| nfr:rail/railweb/content/completeness-20-specs | Content completeness | intake/success_criteria.yaml |
| cons:rail/railweb/safety/ack-gate-live-control | Safety acknowledgement | intake/scope.yml |


## Files produced

- `intake/exports/requirements_8ad06a3.kerml` — KerML-format requirements bundle (machine readable)
- `intake/exports/requirements_8ad06a3.json` — Parsed JSON representation (generated by `tools/parse_kerml.py`)
- `intake/exports/requirements_8ad06a3_trace.csv` — Trace table (req_id → source file)


## How to regenerate

Run the parser included in `tools/parse_kerml.py`:

```cmd
python tools\parse_kerml.py intake\exports\requirements_8ad06a3.kerml --out-dir intake\exports
```


## Notes

- The KerML file is a 1:1 transcription of the SysML-style export produced by `requirements-gpt`. It includes milestone windows and risk records for traceability.
- Suggestion: add `intake/backlog.csv` with at least a placeholder row to close the intake. This helps downstream tools that expect a complete intake bundle.
