# Agent Push Workflow (human-in-the-loop)

This document describes the recommended safe workflow for using GPT agents (local, hosted, or orchestrated via n8n/webhooks) to produce planning, requirements, and architecture artifacts for the `railweb` repository.

High-level flow

1. Planner run: An agent (orchestrated via n8n or run locally) produces a proposed planning artifact and writes a run bundle under `runs/<run-id>/` (or uploads a proposal to a PR). The run bundle MUST include provenance metadata (see `provenance_schema` in `intake/agent_operational_contract.yaml`).
2. Planner review: A human planner reviews the proposal and, if acceptable, adds an approval block to the run metadata (`push_authorized_by`). Approval can be recorded in the run metadata file or in the PR description. The planner may also make small edits in `intake/` directly in VS Code.
3. Requirements stage: If the planner approves, the run or PR is forwarded to Requirements (via n8n webhook or manual hand-off). The Requirements reviewer inspects the proposed requirement rows, provenance, and conflict reports. If acceptable, Requirements may also add their approval block.
4. Architecture stage: The combined approved planning+requirements artifacts are forwarded to Architecture. The architect reviews and may request changes, or add an approval block.
5. Final human push: After the necessary approvals (planner, requirements, architect) are recorded in `runs/<run-id>/meta.yaml` or PR front-matter (see example below), a human operator using VS Code (or an approved automation with a short-lived token) performs the final commit and push to `feature/railweb-mvp`.

Example approval metadata (place under `runs/<run-id>/meta.yaml` or in PR front-matter):

```yaml
run_id: example_run_20250918
provenance:
  source:
    id: example_agent_run_20250918
    title: "Example planning run"
    date: 2025-09-18
    url: "runs/example_run/meta.yaml"
  confidence: 0.8
  rounding_rule: "N/A"

approvals:
  planner:
    name: "alice@example.com"
    timestamp: "2025-09-18T16:20:00Z"
    note: "Reviewed planning updates; OK to proceed to requirements."
  requirements:
    name: "bob@example.com"
    timestamp: "2025-09-18T16:40:00Z"
    note: "Reviewed requirement rows; no conflicts."
  architecture:
    name: "carol@example.com"
    timestamp: "2025-09-18T17:00:00Z"
    note: "Architecture review complete."

push_authorized_by:
  name: "dave@example.com"
  timestamp: "2025-09-18T17:05:00Z"
  reason: "Final review passed â€” ready to commit to feature/railweb-mvp"
```

Notes on n8n/webhook integration

- Orchestrate runs using n8n flows that call your agent endpoint, place outputs into `runs/<run-id>/`, then send a webhook to the assigned reviewer.
- Reviewers receive the webhook and can either:
  - Click a secure link to approve in a simple web UI (which writes the approval into the run metadata), or
  - Manually edit `runs/<run-id>/meta.yaml` in the repo and add the approval block (then open a PR).
- Do NOT grant broad long-lived tokens to the agent. Use short-lived tokens for automated steps and a GitHub App with minimal scopes for any automation that must push.

Minimal checklist before pushing to `feature/railweb-mvp`

- [ ] `runs/<run-id>/meta.yaml` exists
- [ ] `provenance.source.*` fields are present
- [ ] `approvals` includes required signoffs (planner, requirements, architecture) per project policy
- [ ] `push_authorized_by` is present and valid
- [ ] CI provenance check passes (provenance fields validated)

If any step fails, the run should remain unmerged and the reviewer should request changes from the agent or make manual edits.

Maintainers may adapt the required approvers list and the minimal checklist to match changes in the intake contract.
