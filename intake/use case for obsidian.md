i craft requirement requests in obsidian.
md has front matter - id, name, type etc - normally a internal block definition
this request needs to go to the requirement gpt in the intake folder
when a new requirement request goes into intake, the requirements consume it and respond back with requirements. those requirements, after manual review, are then sent back to project gpt and to arch gpt. arch gpt replies with architecture output, which then comes to vs code for ai assist, then to github
