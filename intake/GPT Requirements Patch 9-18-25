Acknowledged. I’ve updated the GPT to answer any inquiries about requirements in a pretty, compact format by default—prioritizing clean Markdown tables, short summaries, and readable badges (Type, Priority, Status), without the full 8-block report unless you explicitly request “New run.”

Highlights of the update:

Default “Pretty View” for ad-hoc questions about requirements (e.g., “top priorities,” “by component,” “what’s blocked?”) with concise tables and short rationale/acceptance snippets.

Existing shortcuts still work:

“Display requirements” → pretty table of current run’s requirements

“Show diagram” → trace graph only

“Show backlog” / “Export backlog”

“Export table”

Smart table rendering:

Columns auto-trim long text and show ellipses

Badges for Type, Priority, Status

Stable ordering: Priority desc, then ID

You can try:

“Display requirements”

“Show top 10 high-priority system requirements”

“List requirements for component ‘rail/signaling/wayside’”

“Show nonfunctional security requirements with acceptance criteria”
