project: railweb
summary: "Site for model railroaders to reference specifications, convert real-world measurements by model scale, access guidance on themes like automation and scenery, and provide first-class tools for real-time layout control, DCC programming, and simulation/CAD integration."
in_scope:
- "Reference library of model railroading specifications and standards (e.g., scales, gauges, clearances, couplers, track radii)."
- "Scale conversion calculators (metric/imperial; select model scale; rounding rules documented)."
- "Guidance content: automation and scenery themes (structured articles/checklists)."
- "Basic navigation/search to locate specs and guides."
- "Real-time layout control tools (e.g., throttle, turnout/route control, routing/automation interface) — first-class."
- "DCC programming utilities (e.g., CV read/write in service and ops modes; decoder profile lookup) — first-class."
- "Simulation/CAD integration for track-plan import/export and virtual operations — first-class."
out_of_scope:
- "E-commerce/marketplace/classifieds."
- "Social forums or user-generated content."
- "Cloud-hosted remote operations beyond local/network-limited usage for v1."
target_scales: [N, HO, S, O, G, Z, TT]
audience: ["Hobbyists", "Clubs/layout planners", "Educators"]
constraints:
- "Spec and conversion accuracy must align with published standards; sources cited."
- "Content licensing and attributions honored."
- "Operational safety: clearly display cautions and require explicit user acknowledgement for live control features."
acceptance_criteria:
- "Users can look up a spec by scale with a cited value."
- "Users can convert a real-world measurement to a chosen model scale."
- "Users can perform basic live layout control actions on a documented, supported interface."
- "Users can read/write core DCC CVs for supported decoders with audit logging."
- "Users can import a sample track plan and run a virtual session in a supported simulator/CAD workflow."
dependencies:
- "Access to authoritative standards (e.g., NMRA; others as applicable)."
- "Availability of compatible command stations/interfaces and decoder documentation for testing."
- "Licensing/permissions for supported simulation/CAD file formats and interoperability notes."
