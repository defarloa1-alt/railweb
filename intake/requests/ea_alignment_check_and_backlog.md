# Use case: Enterprise Architecture alignment (lightweight)

## Summary

An EA alignment note capturing capabilities, stakeholders, interfaces, quality attributes, compliance items, and observed gaps to inform planning and risk tracking.

## Capabilities

- Content Ingestion
- Script Synthesis
- Audio Synthesis (disabled by default)
- Artifact Stitching

## Stakeholders

- Operator (mission control)
- Developer (pipeline maintainer)

## Interfaces / Constraints

- OPENAI API
- ElevenLabs API
- Filesystem (prototype/readwise_audio)
- ffmpeg (local dependency)

## Quality Attributes

- Traceability
- Safety (gating)
- Observability (debug UI)
- Releasability (no auto-publish)

## Compliance

- Provenance preservation policy (rail/railweb/â€¦)
- README intake conventions

## Gaps

- No explicit rate-limit/backoff requirements for real runs.
- No retention policy for generated artifacts.
- No S3/PR publishing contract yet (intended future work).

## Next refinements / actions

- Add task: Enable real-run mode with API gating (depends: SR-2, SR-3).
- Add task: Define publishing path (S3/PR) with human gate (depends: SR-4).

## Provenance

- Created from advisor note (author: AD) on 2025-09-18.
