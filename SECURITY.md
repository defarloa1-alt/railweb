# Security Policy

Report security vulnerabilities to the maintainers by opening an issue labeled `security` or emailing the maintainer.

This repository is an early-stage prototype. It follows these minimum security practices:

- Do not commit secrets or API keys. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- DRY_RUN is enabled by default in prototype tools to avoid accidental external calls.
- We recommend enabling Dependabot and secret scanning in the repository settings.

If you discover a vulnerability, please include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and suggested mitigations.
