The new PR checklist template is added and marked as in-progress. Maintainers, please review for clarity, completeness, and fit to project needs.

Please check:
- Do the checklist items cover necessary safety and citation requirements?
- Is the placement/visibility in the PR template acceptable?
- Any wording changes to make the checklist clearer for contributors or AI helpers?

When reviewed, mark `Request feedback on PR template` as completed in the project TODO list.
